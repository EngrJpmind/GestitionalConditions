                    <p>A miscarriage (also called a spontaneous abortion) is the unexpected ending of a pregnancy in the first 20 weeks of gestation. Just because it’s called a “miscarriage” doesn’t mean you did something wrong in carrying the pregnancy. Most miscarriages are beyond your control and occur because the fetus stops growing.</p>

                    <h4>Cause and Risk Factors</h4>  
                    <hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgb(37, 130, 211); margin-block: 5px;">   
                    <p>What causes miscarriage?<br><br>
                        Chromosomal abnormalities cause about 50% of all miscarriages in the first trimester (up to 13 weeks) of pregnancy. Chromosomes are tiny structures inside the cells of your body that carry your genes. Genes determine all of a person’s physical attributes, such as assigned sex, hair and eye color and blood type.<br><br>
                        During fertilization, when the egg and sperm join, two sets of chromosomes come together. If an egg or sperm has more or fewer chromosomes than normal, the fetus will have an abnormal number. As a fertilized egg grows into a fetus, its cells divide and multiply several times. Abnormalities during this process also leads to miscarriage.<br><br>
                        Most chromosomal problems occur by chance. It’s not completely known why this happens.<br><br>
                        Several factors may cause miscarriage:<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="leee">•	Infection.<br>
                        •	Exposure to TORCH diseases.<br>
                        •	Hormonal imbalances.<br>
                        •	Improper implantation of fertilized egg in your uterine lining.<br>
                        •	How old you are.<br>
                        •	Uterine abnormalities.<br>
                        •	Incompetent cervix (your cervix begins to open too early in pregnancy).<br>
                        •	Lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking alcohol or using recreational drugs.<br>
                        •	Disorders of the immune system like lupus.<br>
                        •	Severe kidney disease.<br>
                        •	Congenital heart disease.<br>
                        •	Diabetes that isn't managed.<br>
                        •	Thyroid disease.<br>
                        •	Radiation.<br>
                        •	Certain medicines, such as the acne drug isotretinoin (Accutane®).<br>
                        •	Severe malnutrition<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>There is no scientific proof that stress, exercise, sexual activity or prolonged use of birth control pills cause miscarriage. Whatever your situation is, it’s important to not blame yourself for having a miscarriage. Most miscarriages have nothing to do with something you did or didn’t do.</p>

                        <span style="font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; color: rgb(95, 154, 230);" class="yon">Your age:</span> Studies show that the risk of miscarriage is 12% to 15% for people in their 20s and rises to about 25% for people by age 40. Most age-related miscarriages happen because of a chromosomal abnormality (the fetus has missing or extra chromosomes).<br><br>
                        <span style="font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; color: rgb(95, 154, 230);">Previous miscarriage:</span> You have a 25% chance of having another miscarriage (only slightly higher than someone who hasn’t had a miscarriage) if you’ve already had one.<br><br>

                    </p>
                    <p>Talk to your pregnancy care provider about the risk factors for miscarriage. They can discuss your risk after they’ve reviewed your medical history.</p>

                        Your pregnancy care provider will perform an ultrasound test to confirm a miscarriage. These tests check for fetal heartbeat or the presence of a yolk sac (one of the first fetal structures your provider can see on ultrasound).
                        You may also have a blood test to measure human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone produced by the placenta. A low hCG level can confirm a miscarriage.
                        Finally, your provider may perform a pelvic exam to check if your cervix has opened.

                        It’s usually not possible to prevent a miscarriage. If you have a miscarriage, it’s not because you did something to cause it. Taking care of your body is the best thing you can do. Some examples of ways to care for yourself include:<br><br>

                    <p class="leee">
                        •	Attending all your prenatal care appointments.<br>
                        •	Maintaining a weight that's healthy for you.<br>
                        •	Avoiding risk factors for miscarriage like drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes.<br>
                        •	Taking a prenatal vitamin.<br>
                        •	Getting regular exercise and eating a healthy diet.

                        Losing a pregnancy can be devastating and leave you with a range of emotions and lots of questions. Healing emotionally from a miscarriage is often harder and longer than the physical healing. Take the time you need to grieve your loss. Talk to your partner, friends and family about your feelings or find a pregnancy loss support group online. Surround yourself with supportive people or seek professional counseling to help you cope with the loss.

                        A miscarriage is a very emotional moment for expectant parents and it’s natural to grieve the loss. Remember that a miscarriage can’t be prevented, and it’s not caused by something you did wrong. It doesn’t mean that you can’t have children or that you’ll have another miscarriage. If you’re planning to become pregnant, reach out to your healthcare provider to discuss the timing of your next pregnancy and ask any questions you have. It’s OK to be sad. Find support from family, friends online support groups or a licensed counselor.

                    <p>Approximately 2 % of pregnancies are ectopic and, because at least minimal bleeding occurs, it is the second most frequent cause of bleeding early in pregnancy. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy appears to be increasing, possibly because of the increasing rate of pelvic inflammatory disease, which can lead to tubal scarring. The incidence is also increased following in vitro fertilization (a patient might be having the in vitro fertilization because of tubal scarring) and also in patients who smoke.</p>
