                    <p>Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a rare condition that occurs during pregnancy, where there is abnormal growth of the cells that form the placenta. This can result in the formation of tumors, which can be benign or cancerous. The most common type of GTD is called hydatidiform mole, also known as a molar pregnancy or H-Mole.<br><br>
                        Bleeding is a common symptom of GTD, with vaginal bleeding occurring in up to 90% of cases. The bleeding can be mild or heavy and can occur at any time during the pregnancy. However, it is most common during the first trimester.<br><br>
                        The exact cause of bleeding in GTD is still unknown, but it is thought to be related to the abnormal growth of the placental cells. The tumors that form in GTD can cause the blood vessels in the uterus to become more fragile and prone to bleeding.<br><br>
                        Bleeding during pregnancy can have several effects, depending on the severity of the bleeding. Mild bleeding may not cause any harm to the mother or the developing fetus, but heavy bleeding can be a serious complication. Heavy bleeding can cause the mother to become anemic, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and other symptoms. It can also lead to miscarriage or preterm labor, which can be life-threatening for the fetus.<br><br>
                        If you experience any bleeding during pregnancy, it is important to contact your healthcare provider immediately. They will be able to evaluate your symptoms and determine the best course of action. In the case of GTD, early diagnosis and treatment are important for a successful outcome.<br>

                    <p>Incompetent cervix occurs when your cervix opens, weakens or shortens too early in pregnancy. It’s also known as cervical insufficiency. It can cause problems including miscarriage (loss of the pregnancy) and premature birth (being born before 37 weeks of pregnancy).<br>

                    <hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgb(37, 130, 211); margin-block: 5px;">   
                    <p>Your cervix is at the lower end of your uterus. It opens to your vagina. Before pregnancy, your cervix is closed and firm. As you near your due date, your cervix softens, shortens (effaces) and opens (dilates) so your baby can be born through your vagina.
                        With cervical insufficiency, your cervix may soften, open or shorten before the fetus is old enough to be born. This puts the fetus at risk for being born too soon — before their organs are fully developed.

                    <p>Unlike other signs of premature labor like contractions or your water breaking, cervical insufficiency may not cause noticeable symptoms.
                        In some people, though, signs of the condition include:                        
                        <br><br>
                    </p>

                        •	Pelvic pressure or pain in your belly.<br>
                        •	Spotting or changes in your vaginal discharge.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        Because there are no symptoms, most pregnancy care providers rely on understanding your health history. This tells them if you may be at risk for an incompetent cervix.

                    <hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgb(37, 130, 211); margin-block: 5px;">   
                    <p>An incompetent cervix can happen at any time in pregnancy. It’s more common in the second trimester of pregnancy (approximately weeks 14 to 27 of pregnancy).

                    <hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgb(37, 130, 211); margin-block: 5px;">   
                    <p>A miscarriage is the loss of pregnancy before 20 weeks. Think of your cervix as a door between your uterus (where the fetus grows) and your vagina. This door should remain closed — ideally until your due date. If this door opens too soon, the fetus may be born before their organs, bones and other structures are fully grown. Almost 25% of second trimester miscarriages are due to an incompetent cervix. Cervical insufficiency can also cause pregnancy loss after 20 weeks (stillbirth).

This includes surgery to treat a cervical problem found during a Pap test. A procedure called a dilation and curettage (D&C) also could be associated with an incompetent cervix. Rarely, a cervical tear during a previous labor and delivery could be a risk factor for an incompetent cervix.<br>

Certain uterine conditions might cause an incompetent cervix. Genetic problems affecting a type of protein that makes up your body's connective tissues, called collagen, might cause an incompetent cervix
